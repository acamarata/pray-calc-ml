Subject: Request for Additional DSLR Twilight Observation Data — Open-Source Prayer Time Research

Assalamu alaykum,

My name is Ali Camarata. I am an independent researcher building an open-source global dataset of verified Fajr twilight observations.

Your DSLR photometry work across Malaysian and Indonesian coastal sites is some of the most valuable per-night observation data in the published literature:

- Kassim Bahali (2018), Sains Malaysiana 47(11):2877-2885 (Pekan, Kuala Terengganu)
- Kassim Bahali et al. (2019), JATMA 7(2):37-48 (21 sites across Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand)

I have extracted all per-date observations from both papers (approximately 90 individual site-night records) and they form a core part of our Malaysian/Indonesian dataset.

I am writing to ask:
1. Do you have additional observation nights beyond what was published in these two papers? Many DSLR campaigns produce more nights than are included in the final publication tables.
2. Have you conducted any Isha (evening twilight / Shafaq al-Abyad) observations? Our Isha dataset is critically small (only 19 records globally) and Malaysian coastal sites would be ideal.
3. Are there any more recent campaigns (2020-2025) at new sites?

Even 10-20 additional per-night records would meaningfully expand the dataset.

Our project: https://github.com/acamarata/pray-calc-ml
Current dataset: 4,200+ Fajr observations from 140+ sites, with Malaysian east-coast sites well represented thanks to your work.

Jazakallahu khairan,
Ali Camarata
