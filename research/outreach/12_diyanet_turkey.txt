Subject: Request for Historical Twilight Observation Records from Diyanet Research (2012-2015 Ankara Campaign)

Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,

My name is Ali Camarata. I am an independent researcher building an open-source dataset of verified Fajr and Isha twilight observations for empirical Islamic prayer time modeling.

I understand that Diyanet conducted twilight observation research in Ankara during approximately 2012-2015, informing Turkey's prayer time methodology. If per-night observation records exist from this campaign (or any other Diyanet twilight observation program), they would be extremely valuable for our global dataset.

For each observation night, I need:
- Calendar date
- City or observation site
- Locally observed time of Fajr onset
- Locally observed time of Isha end (if recorded)
- Sky conditions or observation method

Our project: https://github.com/acamarata/pray-calc-ml
Current dataset: 4,200+ verified Fajr observations from 140+ sites across 20+ countries.

Turkey's latitude (approximately 37-42N) is underrepresented in our dataset, and Diyanet's observations would help calibrate models for the Mediterranean and Central Asian latitude band.

Full attribution to Diyanet in our open-source repository.

Jazakallahu khairan,
