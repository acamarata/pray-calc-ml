Subject: Request for Per-Night SQM Observation Data from LP2024 Multi-Site Twilight Study

Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,

My name is Ali Camarata. I am an independent researcher building an open-source dataset of verified Fajr and Isha twilight observations for empirical Islamic prayer time modeling.

Your 2024 paper in Scientific Reports (PMC11535048), covering SQM observations from 8 Malaysian sites and Coonabarabran, Australia, is one of the most comprehensive multi-site twilight studies published. The geographic spread from equatorial Malaysia to mid-latitude Australia across multiple observation years (2018-2023) is exactly what is needed to build latitude-dependent models.

The published paper presents aggregate depression angles per site. Would you or your co-authors be willing to share the per-night observation data? For each observation night, I need:

- Site name
- Calendar date
- Locally observed time of Fajr onset (morning SQM inflection)
- Locally observed time of Isha end (evening SQM threshold), if applicable
- Sky condition notes

The per-night data would make this the single most valuable contribution to our dataset given the number of sites, years of observation, and latitude range.

Our project: https://github.com/acamarata/pray-calc-ml
Current dataset: 4,200+ Fajr observations from 140+ sites across 20+ countries.
