Subject: Request for Digitized 1987-1989 Blackburn Fajr/Isha Observation Records

Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,

My name is Ali Camarata. I am a researcher working on an open-source project to build a comprehensive dataset of verified Fajr and Isha twilight observations worldwide.

Hizbul Ulama UK conducted pioneering observation campaigns in Blackburn (53.748 N, 2.480 W) during 1987-1989, recording actual Fajr and Isha times through direct human observation. These observations, referenced in academic literature and in Mufti Shabbir Ahmad Sahib's guidance, represent some of the earliest systematic dawn/dusk observation records in the UK.

I currently have 10 records from these observations (6 Fajr, 4 Isha) based on dates cited in secondary sources (Asim Yusuf's "Shedding Light on the Dawn" and related publications). However, the original observation log likely contains hundreds of individual dated records.

Would it be possible to obtain a copy of the full observation log from the 1987-1989 Blackburn campaign? I am interested in:
- Each observation date
- The recorded Fajr time for that date
- The recorded Isha time for that date
- Any notes on sky conditions

Even a photocopy or photograph of the handwritten log would be helpful. I can digitize it.

This data would be historically significant as one of the earliest systematic Fajr/Isha observation campaigns in the UK, and would contribute to ongoing research that benefits the Muslim community's understanding of prayer times at northern latitudes.

The project is open-source and freely available to the community.

Jazakallahu khairan,
Ali Camarata
