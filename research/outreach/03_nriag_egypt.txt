Subject: Request for Per-Night Twilight Observation Data — Open-Source Prayer Time Dataset

Dear Dr. Rashed and Dr. Hassan,

My name is Ali Camarata. I am building an open-source dataset of verified Fajr and Isha twilight observations for empirical Islamic prayer time modeling.

Your research at NRIAG represents some of the most comprehensive twilight photometry work in the Middle East and North Africa region. I have been studying your publications extensively:

- Hassan et al. (2014), NRIAG J. Astronomy & Geophysics 3:23-26 (Kottamia, Baharia, Matrouh, Aswan)
- Hassan et al. (2016), NRIAG J. 5:9-15 (Sinai, Assiut)
- Rashed et al. (2022), IJMET 13(10):8-24 (Wadi al-Hitan, Fayum)
- Semeida & Hassan (2018), BJBAS 7:286-290 (Wadi Al Natron)
- Hassan et al. (2020), Taylor & Francis (multi-site Egypt polynomial model)
- Rashed & Hassan (2025), Springer (6 Egyptian sites, 2015-2019)

These papers publish mean depression angles across many observation nights, but the per-night raw data (specific dates with specific observed times) would be invaluable for training latitude-dependent predictive models.

Would you be willing to share the per-night observation logs from any of your campaigns? The multi-site 2015-2019 dataset (Kottamia, Alexandria, Matrouh, Hurghada, Marsa Alam, Dahab) would be particularly valuable given its geographic diversity across Egypt.

For each observation night, I need:
- Calendar date
- Site name and coordinates
- Local observed time of Fajr onset (morning) and/or Isha onset (evening)
- Sky condition notes (if available)

Our project: https://github.com/acamarata/pray-calc-ml
Current dataset: 4,200+ verified observations from 140+ sites worldwide. Egyptian data currently limited to aggregate records from your publications.

Full attribution to NRIAG would be included in all outputs. I would also be happy to share our compiled global dataset for your own research.

Best regards,
Ali Camarata
