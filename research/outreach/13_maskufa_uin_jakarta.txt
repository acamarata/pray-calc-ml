Subject: Request for Per-Night SQM Observation Data from Labuan Bajo and Bogor Studies

Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,

My name is Ali Camarata. I am an independent researcher building an open-source dataset of verified Fajr observations for empirical Islamic prayer time modeling.

Your 2024 paper in Mazahib 23(1):155-198, covering SQM twilight observations in Labuan Bajo (Flores NTT) and Bogor (West Java), adds valuable data from two geographically distinct Indonesian sites.

Would you be willing to share the per-night observation data from these campaigns? For each observation night, I need:

- Site name
- Calendar date
- Locally observed time of Fajr onset
- SQM readings (if available)
- Sky condition notes

Our project: https://github.com/acamarata/pray-calc-ml
Current dataset: 4,200+ Fajr observations from 140+ sites across 20+ countries.

Labuan Bajo in particular is valuable because of its eastern Indonesian longitude and relatively dark skies.

Jazakallahu khairan,
Ali Camarata
