Subject: Request for Per-Night Data from "Premature Dawn" Multi-Site SQM Study

Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,

My name is Ali Camarata. I am an independent researcher building an open-source dataset of verified Fajr observations for empirical Islamic prayer time modeling.

Your "Premature Dawn" research series with ISRN/UHAMKA, covering SQM observations across 6 Indonesian sites (Padang, Batusangkar, Cirebon, Balikpapan, Bitung, Manokwari), is one of the most geographically diverse Fajr studies in Indonesia. The spread from Sumatra to Papua provides exceptional longitude coverage.

Would you or your co-authors be willing to share the per-night observation data from these campaigns? For each observation night, I need:

- Site name
- Calendar date
- Locally observed time of Fajr onset (morning SQM inflection)
- Sky condition notes (if available)

Our project: https://github.com/acamarata/pray-calc-ml
Current dataset: 4,200+ Fajr observations from 140+ sites across 20+ countries.

Your multi-site data would significantly improve our coverage of the equatorial Indonesian archipelago, where longitude effects on prayer timing are particularly important.

Jazakallahu khairan,
Ali Camarata
